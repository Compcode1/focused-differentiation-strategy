    "### **Project Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to analyze the inventory of this existing store  with the goal of determining ways to maximize profit margins in a new subsidiary (optomized) store aimed at high profit sales. This is commonly called a **Focused Differentiation Strategy**. (We will not address overhead issues in this project as we do not have this data. Overhead would need to be subtracted from total profit in a real world setting.) This project focuses on the viability of a smaller but more profit centered additional location and/ or markerting directive. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data is derived from the [Superstore Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishanshrivastava28/superstore-sales). The dataset includes sales, profit, and inventory data providing a comprehensive view of sales performance across various regions, product categories, and customer segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identifying the top-selling and most profitable products.\n",
    "2. Analyzing products with low or negative profit margins to consider for removal.\n",
    "3. Evaluating the impact of discounts on profit margins and sales.\n",
    "4. Recommending an optimized product mix for the new store, focusing on high-profit-margin items.\n",
    "5. Using predictive modeling to forecast the future performance of the new store based on the proposed changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Analysis Techniques:\n",
    "- **Profit Margin Analysis**: We will calculate the profit margin for each product category and individual products to identify top performers.\n",
    "- **Predictive Modeling**: A predictive model will be used to estimate the future sales and profits for the new store based on the optimized product mix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Libraries Needed:\n",
    "To perform the analysis, we will use the following Python libraries:\n",
    "- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- **numpy**: For numerical operations.\n",
    "- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: For data visualization.\n",
    "- **scikit-learn**: For predictive modeling and clustering.\n",
    "- **statsmodels**: For statistical analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will provide actionable insights to optimize inventory decisions and maximize profitability in the new store, building on the sales data and performance of the existing store.\n"

    "#### **Initial Data Inspection and Summary Statistics**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this initial step, I begin by importing the necessary libraries, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, and `statsmodels` for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The dataset, imported from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishanshrivastava28/superstore-sales), is loaded from my Desktop into a DataFrame. After loading the dataset, we inspect the first few rows using the `head()` function to get a preview of the dataset's structure and values. This is followed by generating summary statistics for the dataset using the `describe()` function, which provides key metrics such as mean, standard deviation, and percentiles for the numerical columns. We also check for any missing values in the dataset using the `isnull().sum()` function, which returns the count of missing values for each column. Finally, the data types of each column are inspected using the `dtypes` attribute, and necessary conversions (e.g., date and categorical columns) are made to ensure that the data types are appropriate for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synopsis of the Output:\n",
    "- **Head of the Data**: The first five rows reveal various attributes of the dataset, including `Order ID`, `Order Date`, `Ship Mode`, customer information, location details, product categories, sales, discounts, and profits.\n",
    "- **Summary Statistics**: The dataset contains 9,994 records. The statistics show the average sales value is $229.86 with a maximum sale of $22,638.48. The dataset also provides insights into quantities, discounts, and profits, where the average profit is $28.66, but some records show negative profits (up to -$6,599.98).\n",
    "- **Missing Values**: No missing values are present in the dataset.\n",
    "- **Data Types**: Columns such as `Order Date` and `Ship Date` have been converted to datetime format, while categorical columns such as `Ship Mode`, `Region`, and `Category` have been converted to the correct type for analysis. Other columns, such as `Sales` and `Profit`, are properly categorized as numerical data types.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this initial analysis, we calculated key financial metrics for the existing store, which serve as a benchmark for evaluating the impact of discounts and other factors on overall profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Metrics:\n",
    "- **Total Sales**: $2,297,200.86\n",
    "- **Total Profit**: $286,397.02\n",
    "- **Overall Profit Margin**: 12.47%\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Industry Context:\n",
    "For the **electronics and appliance industry**, profit margins vary, but generally fall within certain ranges:\n",
    "- **Consumer Electronics**: Margins are typically lower due to high competition and product costs, usually around **5-10%**.\n",
    "- **Home Appliances**: Margins are somewhat higher, often ranging from **10-15%**, with premium products sometimes reaching the higher end of this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "The **12.47%** profit margin calculated for the existing store places it on the higher end of typical industry benchmarks. This suggests that the store is performing well in terms of profitability, particularly if it deals with electronics or appliances where margins tend to be tighter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This profitability benchmark provides important context for evaluating the impact of future decisions, such as discount strategies, on both sales and profit margins.\n"

    "####  **Evaluating the Impact of Discounts on Profit Margins and Sales**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we explored the relationship between discounts, sales, and profit margins, focusing on whether higher discounts lead to increased sales and how they affect profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculations Used:\n",
    "1. **Profit Margin Calculation**:\n",
    "   - We calculated the **Profit Margin** for each product using the formula:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\text{Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{Sales}} \\right) \\times 100\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   - This gives the percentage of profit relative to sales, showing how much profit is made for every dollar of sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correlation Between Discounts and Profit Margin**:\n",
    "   - To analyze the relationship between **Discount** and **Profit Margin**, we calculated the **correlation coefficient** using the formula for Pearson correlation. This value tells us how strongly discounts are related to changes in profit margins.\n",
    "   - A **negative correlation coefficient** indicates that as discounts increase, profit margins tend to decrease. In this case, the correlation was **-0.8645**, a strong negative relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Top Discounted Products**:\n",
    "   - We grouped products by **Product Name** and calculated the **average discount**, **average sales**, and **average profit margin** for each product.\n",
    "   - The top 10 products with the highest discounts were identified by sorting products by **average discount percentage** in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Average Sales and Profit Margins for High-Discount Products**:\n",
    "   - For these top-discounted products, we calculated the **average sales** and **average profit margin** across the products. This helps us understand the overall effect of discounts on sales and profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Findings:\n",
    "1. **Correlation between Discount and Profit Margin**:\n",
    "   - The correlation is **-0.8645**, indicating a **strong negative relationship**. As discounts increase, profit margins tend to decrease significantly, meaning higher discounts are damaging profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Top 10 Products by Discount Percentage**:\n",
    "   - The products with the highest discounts (up to 80%) all have **negative profit margins**, with some as low as **-275%**. This shows that heavy discounting is having a severely negative impact on profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sales and Profit Margins for Top Discount Products**:\n",
    "   - Despite high discounts, the **average sales** for these top-discount products is relatively low at **$224.57**.\n",
    "   - The **average profit margin** for these products is **-126.39%**, meaning these discounts are not driving significant sales but are substantially reducing profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusions:\n",
    "- High discounts are not leading to proportionately high sales and are resulting in **deep negative profit margins**.\n",
    "- There is a need to reconsider the discount strategy for products receiving high discounts, as it is severely impacting profitability.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Calculations:\n",
    "1. **Percentage of Items Receiving Discounts**:\n",
    "   - We counted the number of unique products that received any discount (where `Discount > 0`) and calculated the percentage relative to the total number of products.\n",
    "   - Formula: \n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Percentage of Items with Discounts} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of Items with Discounts}}{\\text{Total Number of Items}} \\right) \\times 100\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Percentage of Total Sales from Discounted Items**:\n",
    "   - We summed the total sales from products that received discounts and calculated the percentage of these sales relative to the total sales.\n",
    "   - Formula: \n",
    "     \\[\n",

    "     \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results:\n",
    "- **Percentage of Items Receiving Discounts**: **89.52%**\n",
    "   - Nearly 90% of the store's products are being discounted, indicating a heavy reliance on discounts.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Percentage of Total Sales from Discounted Items**: **52.64%**\n",
    "   - Over half of the total sales come from discounted products, but it does not represent the full majority, suggesting that discounts are not the sole driver of sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **Heavy Discounting Strategy**: With 89.52% of the products receiving discounts, the store is applying discounts broadly across its inventory. However, only 52.64% of sales come from these discounted items, which implies that discounts may not be as effective in driving sales for all products.\n",
    "- **Potential for Optimizing Discounts**: Given that discounts are applied to almost all products but are generating only half of the total sales, there may be room to optimize the discount strategy. Focusing discounts on specific products or categories that respond well to them\n"

    "#### **Grouped Bar Chart: Total Sales and Profit Comparison**\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization provides a comparison between the **base store** and the **optimized product mix** in terms of **total sales** and **total profit**. The goal is to visually contrast the decreased sales but higher profit in the optimized store.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total Sales**: This represents the total revenue generated by each store.\n",
    "- **Total Profit**: This shows the cumulative profit generated by each store.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Insights:\n",
    "- The **base store** has higher total sales, but its total profit is lower, indicating that a significant portion of its sales are driven by low-margin or discounted items.\n",
    "- The **optimized store** has significantly lower total sales, but its total profit is higher due to focusing on non-discounted, high-margin items, making the store more profitable overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chart highlights the **trade-off** between total sales and profitability, showcasing how an optimized product mix can lead to higher profits despite lower sales.\n",

    "#### **Conclusion: Focused Differentiation Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most appropriate technical term for the approach taken in this analysis is a **\"Focused Differentiation Strategy\"**. This strategy allows the new subsidiary store to differentiate itself by focusing on a carefully selected, high-margin product mix, designed to maximize profitability rather than maximizing overall sales volume. The results of the analysis provide strong support for the success of this approach, using various techniques to derive insights from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Supporting Statistics:\n",
    "- **Total Sales**: \n",
    "   - The total sales for the base store were **$2,297,200.86**, while the optimized product mix generated **$1,087,908.47**. \n",
    "   - Despite the **52.6% reduction in total sales**, the focus on high-margin items still led to a more profitable outcome.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Total Profit**: \n",
    "   - The total profit for the base store was **$286,397.02**, compared to the optimized store's **$320,987.60**. \n",
    "   - This represents a **12.1% increase in profit** in the optimized store, achieved by eliminating low or negative-profit products and focusing on profitable, non-discounted items.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Profit Margin**: \n",
    "   - The overall profit margin for the base store was **12.47%**, while the profit margin for the optimized store was **199.00%**.\n",
    "   - This **dramatic improvement in profitability** underscores the effectiveness of the focused differentiation strategy, which concentrates on high-margin products to drive profit, even at lower sales volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Techniques Employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this focused differentiation, I applied several key techniques to thoroughly analyze and tease out insights from the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Data Inspection and Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - I began by conducting an **initial data inspection**, identifying missing values, ensuring appropriate data types (e.g., converting date columns to datetime), and checking for inconsistencies.\n",
    "   - This cleaning process set the foundation for accurate analysis by ensuring the integrity of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Grouping and Aggregation**:\n",
    "   - By **grouping products** based on their names and calculating their **average sales** and **average profit margins**, I was able to categorize products by their financial performance.\n",
    "   - This allowed me to identify top-selling and most profitable products, which provided insight into which items could be prioritized for the new store.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Profit Margin Calculation**:\n",
    "   - A crucial step was calculating the **profit margin** for each product using the formula:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{Sales}} \\right) \\times 100\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - This metric provided a clear view of how efficiently each product converted sales into profit, guiding decisions on which products to include in the optimized product mix.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Correlation Analysis**:\n",
    "   - To explore the relationship between **discounts** and **profit margins**, I calculated the **correlation coefficient** between these two variables. \n",
    "   - The negative correlation of **-0.8645** revealed that higher discounts tend to reduce profit margins, helping us make the strategic decision to focus on non-discounted items.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analysis of High-Discount Products**:\n",
    "   - I identified and analyzed the **top products by discount percentage** to assess their sales and profit margins. The analysis showed that while high discounts boosted sales, they significantly hurt profitability, reinforcing our focus on non-discounted items.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Elimination of Low-Profit Items**:\n",
    "   - Products with **negative profit margins** were filtered out from the dataset, as they were contributing to overall losses. This step was critical in shaping the new store's optimized product mix, ensuring that only profitable items remained.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Optimized Product Mix**:\n",
    "   - After filtering and cleaning, we established the **optimized product mix** by focusing on high-margin, non-discounted products. This mix provided a significant increase in profitability with reduced sales volume, reflecting the value of a targeted strategy.\n",
    "  \n",
    "8. **Benchmarking and Comparison**:\n",
    "   - By comparing the **total sales**, **total profit**, and **profit margin** of the base store and the optimized product mix, we were able to benchmark the performance of the new strategy. This comparison showed the substantial gains in profitability despite the reduced sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By employing these techniques, I uncovered the financial realities within the dataset, allowing us to make informed decisions about the product mix for the new subsidiary store. The **Focused Differentiation Strategy**—which centers on eliminating low-margin products, focusing on high-margin non-discounted items, and leveraging profitability over sales volume—proved to be a highly effective approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a store model that prioritizes **profitability over revenue growth**, yielding a much higher **profit margin** and **total profit**, even with a smaller selection of products. This optimized approach not only enhances the store's financial performance but also offers a sustainable long-term strategy for growth. Other overhead and marketing  realities were not considered in this data engineering project but would certainly be necessary in further business exploration study efforts. \n"
